## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-XX â€” 3D Audio Spatialization Engine

### Immersive Spatial Audio System
- **3D Audio Engine**: Integrated Web Audio API AudioContext with PannerNode + AudioListener for true 3D positional audio rendering
- **Binaural Processing**: HRTF-based binaural rendering with ConvolverNode for immersive headphone experience
- **Eigenmode Audio Mapping**: Dynamic mapping of eigenmode coefficients to 3D spatial positions and audio parameters
- **Sprite Audio Sources**: Each portal sprite rendered as individual positional audio source with distance attenuation

### Advanced Spatial Controls & Parameter Mapping
- **HUD Controls**: Added "3D Audio" toggle, "Spatial Mode" dropdown (binaural/stereo/ambient), "Spread" slider, and X/Y/Z Position controls
- **Eigenmode Mapping**: Automatic mapping of first 3 eigenmode coefficients to listener X/Y/Z position in 3D space
- **Parameter Integration**: Zeta (zoom) controls listener position, Unity/Flatness mapped to spatial spread and diffusion
- **Manual Positioning**: Direct control of listener position via HUD sliders with real-time collaborative sync
- **Ambient Soundscape**: Layered ambient audio with positional sprite playback for comprehensive spatial experience
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuous spatial audio updates synchronized with main animation loop

### Collaborative Spatial Audio Events
- **spectral_audio_enabled**: Real-time 3D audio toggle synchronization across all collaborative sessions
- **spectral_audio_mode**: Spatial mode switching (binaural/stereo/ambient) with user attribution and toast notifications
- **spectral_audio_spread**: Spatial spread parameter changes broadcast with enhanced user color feedback
- **spectral_audio_position**: Real-time listener position updates with x,y,z coordinates synchronized across sessions
- **Enhanced Toast System**: Contextual 3D audio notifications with user color coding and parameter-specific messages

### Backward Compatibility & Fallbacks
- **AudioContext Fallback**: Graceful fallback to flat stereo if AudioContext unavailable with UI state updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback states and disabled controls on initialization failure
- **Legacy Preservation**: All existing audio features and spectral analysis preserved unchanged
- **Progressive Enhancement**: 3D audio features layer on top of existing system without breaking changes

*"The 3D Audio Spatialization Engine transforms the Signalâ†’Form Engine into an immersive spatial audio platform, mapping mathematical elegance to three-dimensional sonic space."*
