## CURRENT WORKING FEATURES ✅

### 1. MIDI System (FULLY FUNCTIONAL)
- **Dual MIDI Architecture:**
  - Web MIDI API (direct hardware controllers)
  - WebSocket MIDI (Ableton via bridge)
- **Window Focus Isolation:** Prevents cross-talk between browser windows
- **Active Controls:**
  - CC1 (Mod Wheel): Cube to sphere morphing
  - CC2 (Pitch Wheel): **ACCUMULATED X-axis rotation** (doesn't snap back)
  - CC4: Y-axis rotation
  - Notes: Trigger form morphing (Blake/Tesla/Beatles based on note % 12)

### 2. Visual Layers (ACTIVE)
- **Vessel Layer:** MIDI-responsive morphing shapes
- **Emergent Form Layer:** Complex geometric formations
- **Particle Layer:** Dynamic particle systems
- **Skybox Cube Layer:** Main geometric controller with subdivision morphing
- **Shadow Layer:** DISABLED (was causing flashing issues)

### 3. Audio System (ARCHITECTURE READY)
- **BlackHole Integration:** Routes Ableton audio to browser
- **AudioInputManager:** Real-time analysis framework
- **Analysis Pipeline:** Frequency bands, RMS, peak detection
- **Callback System:** Centralized in main.ts
- **Status:** Framework complete, analysis not actively triggering visuals

### 4. UI Panel System (FUNCTIONAL)
- **Panel Toolbar:** Centralized control for all panels
- **Cymatic Patterns Panel:** Frequency visualization (no 3D interference)
- **Audio Input Selector:** Source management
- **Space Morph Toolbox, VJ Interface, etc.:** Mode-specific tools
- **Clean State:** No more debug spam or unwanted overlays

### 5. Mode System
- **VJ Mode:** Performance-focused interface
- **Installation Mode:** Space morph tools
- **Studio Mode:** Audio analysis tools

## RECENT FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS

### Session Accomplishments
1. **Fixed MIDI window isolation** - prevents cross-talk between instances
2. **Removed visual interference** - eliminated black cymatic plane from main scene
3. **Cleaned up debug logging** - removed console spam
4. **Improved CC2 control** - accumulated rotation instead of snapping
5. **Consolidated audio analysis** - single clear pipeline
6. **Fixed panel visibility** - toolbar and panels working correctly

### Code Changes Made
- **MIDI Focus System:** Window-based isolation in WebSocketMIDIClient
- **Cymatic Patterns:** Removed from main scene, kept panel-only
- **Audio Analysis:** Centralized callback in main.ts
- **CC2 Rotation:** Delta-based accumulation instead of absolute positioning
- **Debug Cleanup:** Removed excessive console logging

### Data Flow
```
MIDI Input (Ableton)
    → WebSocketMIDIClient (focus isolation)
    → MMPAEngine.handleMIDIMessage()
    → SkyboxCubeLayer (CC controls)
    → Visual Updates

Audio Input (BlackHole)
    → AudioInputManager.analyzeLoop()
    → main.ts callback
    → [Engine, AudioSelector, CymaticPanel]
    → Frequency visualization
```

### Current MIDI Mapping
- **CC1:** Cube to sphere morphing (0-127 → morphing progress)
- **CC2:** X-axis rotation (accumulated, doesn't snap back)
- **CC4:** Y-axis rotation (absolute positioning)
- **Notes:** Form selection based on note % 12

## SYSTEM HEALTH STATUS

### ✅ WORKING PERFECTLY
- MIDI responsiveness and control
- Visual morphing and transformations
- Panel visibility and toolbar
- Window focus isolation
- CC2 accumulated rotation
- Clean console output

### ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION
- Audio analysis not actively driving visuals
- Some panels may need fine-tuning
- Performance optimization opportunities

### ❌ DISABLED/REMOVED
- Shadow layer (was causing visual issues)
- 3D cymatic patterns (interference with main scene)
- Debug logging spam

## NEXT PHASE: SIGNAL→FORM ENGINE

### Incoming Revolution
We are about to implement a **mathematically grounded spectral graph theory engine** based on the comprehensive specification in:
- `signal→form_engine_quantification_spec_claude_handoff_v_0.md`
- Python prototypes in `signal_form_starter_python/`

### Key Concepts to Implement
1. **Laplacian Eigenmodes ("Eaganvectors")** - spectral graph analysis
2. **AIWS V-I-T → RGB Mapping** - quantified visual/identity/time distortions
3. **Stokes-like Polarization** - two-mode duality analysis
4. **Dewey Decimal Ontology** - mode organization (000-900)
5. **Heat Kernel Green Functions** - spatial diffusion analysis
6. **Unity/Flatness Control** - "white light" spectral balance
7. **Safety Grounding Presets** - baseline reality anchors

### Implementation Strategy
- Keep current working system as foundation
- Build spectral engine as overlay/enhancement
- Maintain MIDI responsiveness and panel system
- Add mathematical quantification layer
- Implement safety and grounding controls
