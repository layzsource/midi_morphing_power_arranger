# 🎶 Universal Signal-to-Form Engine

*A performance instrument, a living myth, a library of thinkers*

## 🌍 Overview

The Universal Signal-to-Form Engine transforms **signal → form** across multiple modalities (sound, shape, color, shadow, motion). It functions simultaneously as:

- **🎚️ DJ/VJ Instrument** - Real-time audio-visual performance
- **🏛️ Installation Tool** - Immersive artistic experiences
- **🧠 Language Platform** - Emergent communication through pattern

> *"All signal is form, all form is signal. Music is the universal language — but vibration, frequency, and pattern are even deeper."*

## ⚡ Architecture

### Four Archetypal Layers
- **🔲 Vessel** → Container, geometry, architecture (Russell's cube-sphere cosmology)
- **🌐 Emergent Form** → Dynamic surfaces and evolving shapes (Blake, Tesla, Beatles)
- **✨ Particles** → Motion, texture, rhythm, energy bursts (Lead Belly, Hawking, Pranksters)
- **🌑 Shadow** → Negative space, inversion, absence (Hoffman, Waas)

### Signal Grammar
MIDI, audio, and data streams map into visual transformations:
- **Frequency bands** → shape morphing and color shifts
- **MIDI CC** → layer intensity and geometry scaling
- **Beat detection** → particle emission bursts
- **Silence** → shadow inversions and trickster modes

### Performance Modes
- **🔥 Club Mode** → High-energy, rhythmic, strobing visuals
- **🏛️ Installation Mode** → Ambient, contemplative, slow morphing
- **🎹 Instrument Mode** → Expressive, responsive, intimate performance

## 📚 Core Library (Easter Eggs)

Each thinker/artist has embedded "signature" cues that appear in sound/visuals:

### Vessel Layer
- **Walter Russell** → Cosmic geometry, harmonic drones (256Hz trigger)
- **Constance Greiff** → Architectural memory, cathedral reverb (silence trigger)
- **Albert Einstein** → Relativistic patterns, time-space bending (432Hz trigger)

### Emergent Form Layer
- **William Blake** → Mystical morphing, visionary chants (227.43Hz trigger)
- **Nikola Tesla** → Electrical resonance, 3-6-9 patterns (369Hz trigger)
- **The Beatles** → Harmonic convergence, collective creation (harmonic series trigger)

### Particle Layer
- **Lead Belly** → Blues rhythms, earth tones (12-bar pattern trigger)
- **Stephen Hawking** → Cosmic radiation, black hole spirals (sub-bass trigger)
- **Merry Pranksters** → Kaleidoscopic chaos, psychedelic bursts (random trigger)

### Shadow Layer
- **Abbie Hoffman** → Rebellious inversions, disruptive flashes (amplitude spike trigger)
- **Les Waas** → Absurd timing, comic delays (absurd number trigger)

## 🎮 Controls

### Keyboard Controls
- **1** → Trigger Russell archetype
- **2** → Trigger Blake archetype
- **3** → Trigger Tesla archetype
- **Space** → Manual beat trigger
- **R** → Reset all layers

### MIDI Controls
- **CC 1** (Mod Wheel) → Particle speed
- **CC 7** (Volume) → Particle opacity
- **CC 10** (Pan) → Particle spread
- **Note On** → Frequency analysis and layer morphing

### Audio Input
- Real-time microphone analysis
- Automatic beat detection
- Frequency spectrum mapping to visual layers
- Silence detection for shadow inversions

npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

### Permissions Required
- **Microphone** → Audio analysis and beat detection
- **MIDI** → Hardware controller integration

## 🎨 Technical Implementation

### Built With
- **Three.js** → 3D rendering and scene management
- **Web Audio API** → Real-time audio analysis
- **Web MIDI API** → Hardware controller integration
- **TypeScript** → Type-safe development
- **Vite** → Fast development and building

### Architecture Patterns
- **Layer System** → Modular visual components
- **Signal Grammar** → Universal input translation
- **Archetype Library** → Cultural pattern database
- **Easter Egg System** → Hidden interactive elements

## 🔮 Philosophy

### White Queen Mode
*"Time is not linear - the engine is already alive in the future. Build backward from its demands."*

### Dual Perception
Geometry and sound shift meaning based on context - the performance itself becomes language emergence.

### HAL Personas
AI co-performer modes:
- **Oracle** → Solemn, mythic guidance
- **Trickster** → Playful, glitching, remixing
- **Cosmic Narrator** → Vast commentary, poetic
- **Silent Shadow** → Absence, withdrawal, minimalism

*"Not 'as if' it is alive. It **already is** alive."*
