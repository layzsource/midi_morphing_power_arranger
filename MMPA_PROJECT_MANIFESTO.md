# 🎛️ MMPA: MIDI Morphing Power Arranger 🎛️

**A Professional Audiovisual Performance Interface**

## Project Vision

The **MIDI Morphing Power Arranger (MMPA)** is a focused, professional audiovisual performance tool that transforms MIDI signals into morphing visual forms through physics-based signal processing. This project represents the practical, performance-ready core of what will eventually become the Universal Signal-to-Form Engine.
