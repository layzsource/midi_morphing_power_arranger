# Glossary of Terms

## Vessel Scaffolding ✓ PROPER IMPLEMENTATION
**Status: Complete and Verified**

A 3D geometric structure consisting of 6 rings positioned at the faces of an invisible cube. Each ring lies flat within its respective cube face (front, back, left, right, top, bottom), with the ring radius matching the half-cube size so the edges touch all four sides of each square face. This creates a pure geometric framework without visible cube lines - just the 6 rings maintaining cube formation through their positioning and orientation.

**Features:**
- 6 rings in perfect cube formation (3×3×3 space)
- Optional motion system with slow rotation, gyration, and breathing
- Contains 2500 free-flowing particles that morph between sphere and merkaba
- Toggleable motion control via UI button
- Sacred geometry foundation for universal signal processing

**Implementation Date:** 2025-09-20
**File:** `/src/layers/VesselLayer.ts`

## Sonoluminescence Sprite Emission System ✓ INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION
**Status: Prototype Complete**

A dynamic sprite emission system where the "heart" (emergent form layer) acts as a sonic cavitation source, emitting encoded photon sprites that travel outward, cast shadow data, and return for cellular integration.

**Features:**
- Heart-based sprite emission triggered by expansion cycles
- Four-phase sprite lifecycle: expanding → projecting → returning → integrating
- Temporal data encoding (timestamp, form state, emission context)
- Shadow casting onto vessel scaffolding rings
- Wax cylinder-style information recording over time
- Sprites travel away from viewer, expand, then return to particle system

**Implementation Date:** 2025-09-20
**Files:** `/src/layers/EmergentFormLayer.ts`

**Next Steps:**
- Enhanced shadow casting precision onto vessel rings
- Cellular osmosis integration with particle system
- Audio-responsive emission rates
- Multi-layer shadow encoding

## Physics-Based Fluid Dynamics System ✓ COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION
**Status: Fully Integrated**

A comprehensive physics-based signal encoding system that uses fluid dynamics, cavitation bubbles, and sonoluminescence to create meaningful signal-to-form transformations with particle physics properties.

**Features:**
- Real-time fluid dynamics simulation (pressure, viscosity, temperature, flow)
- Cavitation bubble formation and collapse triggering sprite emission
- Comprehensive physics encoding (chirality, helicity, charge, quark flavor, polarization)
- Dewey decimal classification system for signal organization
- Hindu form-frequency resonance mapping (Sri Yantra, Om Symbol, Flower of Life)
- Circularly polarized light simulation with rotation and phase
- Multi-phase sprite lifecycle with physics-based movement
- Yantra pattern visualization and decay simulation
- Encoded shadow casting with temporal data storage

**Physics Properties Integration:**
- Chirality (left/right) → sprite rotation direction
- Helicity (parallel/antiparallel) → spin relative to momentum
- Charge (-1 to +1) → brightness, size, and movement characteristics
- Quark flavors → geometric complexity and color coding
- Polarization → circular rotation patterns and phase relationships
- Decay patterns → sprite stability and coherence states

**Signal Classification:**
- 100s: Frequency-based transformations
- 200s: MIDI-based interactions
- 300s: Archetypal manifestations
- 400s: User input responses
- 500s: Temporal pattern encoding
