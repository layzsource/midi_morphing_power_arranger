### **Engine Integration Success**

**Problem Identified:** Portal warp system was passing objects to engine method expecting single numbers
**Solution Implemented:** Proper integration with existing `setPortalWarp(number)` API

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Fixed: Use existing engine API correctly
engine.setPortalWarp(this.performanceState.portalWarp); // Single number

// Enhanced: Direct camera manipulation for new axes
engine.camera.position.y = yOffset; // Y-axis control
engine.camera.position.x *= zoomScale; // Zoom control
```

## üîß PROBLEM-SOLVING HIGHLIGHTS

### **The Great Blackout Mystery**

**Symptoms:** All portal warp controls causing complete view blackout, persisting even after reset

**Investigation Process:**
1. **Initial hypothesis:** Zoom range too extreme (0.1-2.0x)
2. **First fix attempt:** Reduced to safer range (0.5-1.5x)
3. **Persistent issue:** Blackouts continued on all axes
4. **Root cause discovery:** Engine API mismatch - passing objects to number-expecting method

**Final Resolution:**
- Identified existing `setPortalWarp(number)` method in engine
- Discovered we were passing `{x, y, zoom}` object instead of single number
- Redesigned to work with existing API while adding new functionality
- Result: Smooth operation across all three axes

### **Debugging Strategy Success**

**Tools Implemented:**
- Comprehensive console logging of all portal values
- Emergency disable button for critical recovery
- Enhanced reset functionality with engine state restoration
- Real-time status display showing actual applied values

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always check existing engine APIs before implementing new features
- Safety controls are essential for live performance tools
- Debug logging invaluable for complex camera transformations
- User experience demands immediate recovery options
