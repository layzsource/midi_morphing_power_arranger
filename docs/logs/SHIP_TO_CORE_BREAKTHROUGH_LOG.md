## 🌊 **THE "SHIP TO CORE" EXPERIENCE**

### **What Makes This Feel Like Ship Control:**

1. **3D Spatial Navigation**:
   - **Yaw Control** (CC1): Rotate environment left/right like ship steering
   - **Pitch Control** (CC2): Tilt environment up/down like ship elevation
   - **Zoom Control** (CC5): Navigate from cosmic overview to intimate detail

2. **Dead Zone Precision**:
   - **Rest Positions**: Controllers snap to neutral when released
   - **No Drift**: Ship stays steady when hands are off controls
   - **Smooth Response**: Gradual acceleration from dead zones

3. **Environmental Targeting**:
   - **Panel Selection** (CC6): Choose which "sector" to modify
   - **Real-time Feedback**: Visual confirmation of selected targets
   - **Independent Control**: Each environment face controllable separately

4. **Immersive 360° Environment**:
   - **6-Panel Cube**: Floor, Ceiling, 4 Walls = complete surround
   - **Shadow Integration**: Vessel shadows project onto environment
   - **Dynamic Content**: Real-time image/video application to any surface
