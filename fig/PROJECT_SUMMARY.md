## 🎵 **"The Language of Signals Becoming Form" - Achieved!**

Both versions embody the MMPA philosophy:

### **Signals** → **Language** → **Becoming** → **Form**
- **Audio Input** → **Mathematical Analysis** → **Real-time Processing** → **Visual Feedback**

**Advanced Version** delivers the complete vision:
- Professional spectral analysis transforms audio **signals**
- Mathematical processing creates the analytical **language**
- Real-time updates show signals **becoming** form
- GUI displays represent the final **form** of analysis
