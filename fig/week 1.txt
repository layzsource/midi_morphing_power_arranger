WEEK 1 TESTING GUIDE - COMPLETE CINEMATIC RENDERING SYSTEM
================================================================================

## üé¨ Primary Testing Command

**Main System Test:**
```bash
cd /Users/ticegunther/morphing_interface/fig
python3 mmpa_ultimate_professional.py
```

This will launch the complete MMPA Ultimate Professional System with all the cinematic rendering features.

## üîç Expected Launch Output

**System Initialization Messages:**

- üé® 21 professional geometric shapes available
- üé¨ Cinematic HDR rendering pipeline available
- ‚ú® Bloom, tone mapping, and volumetric lighting ready
- üé≠ Film-quality visual effects enabled

## üéõÔ∏è UI Features to Test

**1. Morphing Tab:**
- Try different geometric shapes (21 total available)
- Test sacred geometry: Chestahedron, Seed of Life, Flower of Life, Metatron's Cube
- Adjust resolution slider (up to 2000+ points)
- Test multi-layer morphing (up to 7 layers)

**2. Visual Effects Tab:**
- Test new PBR Materials section with 8 presets:
  * Gold (metallic: 100%, roughness: 10%)
  * Silver (metallic: 100%, roughness: 10%)
  * Copper (metallic: 100%, roughness: 15%)
  * Plastic (metallic: 0%, roughness: 30%)
  * Glass (metallic: 0%, roughness: 5%)
  * Rubber (metallic: 0%, roughness: 90%)
  * Ceramic (metallic: 0%, roughness: 10%)
  * Crystal (metallic: 10%, roughness: 2%, emission enabled)
- Adjust Metallic, Roughness, and Emission sliders
- Test particle system controls

**3. Performance Tab:**
- Monitor enhanced features status
- Verify 60 FPS performance target
- Check CPU and memory usage
- Confirm HDR and PBR features are active

**4. Musical Tab:**
- Test real-time audio-visual synchronization
- Verify 16-genre ML classification
- Test manual controls for genre, tempo, amplitude

## üéØ Key Cinematic Features to Verify

- 2048x2048 shadow map resolution

**Sacred Geometry Integration:**
- Frank Chester's Chestahedron (7 equal faces)
- Seed of Life (7 overlapping circles)
- Flower of Life (19 overlapping circles)
- Metatron's Cube (13 circles with connecting lines)

## üìä Performance Expectations

- **Target FPS:** 60 FPS sustained
- **Resolution:** 2000+ points per shape
- **Active Layers:** Up to 7 simultaneous layers
- **Particles:** Up to 25,000 active particles
- **Memory Usage:** Optimized with shape caching
- **CPU Usage:** Under 30% on modern systems

## üîÑ Alternative Testing Commands
