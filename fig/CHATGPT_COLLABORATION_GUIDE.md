Help me design the mathematical algorithm for organic tree-like structures.
```

### 3. **For Unreal Engine C++ Questions**
**Share with ChatGPT:**
```
I'm porting a Python audio visualization system to Unreal Engine 5.3.
Here's my current Python audio processor: [paste mmpa_audio_processor.py]

Help me design the C++ AudioAnalysisManager class architecture.
```

### 4. **For Integration Strategy**
**Share with ChatGPT:**
```
I need to integrate my Unreal visualization system with:

## üí° Best Practices for Dual-AI Collaboration

### **Do:**
- Share specific code sections rather than entire files
- Ask focused, technical questions
- Provide context about real-time requirements
- Bring insights back for practical implementation

### **Don't:**
- Share entire large codebases at once
- Ask overly broad questions
- Expect ChatGPT to handle file operations
- Forget to test suggestions in real environment

### **Remember:**
- Claude Code maintains project continuity
- ChatGPT provides additional perspectives
- Both AIs have different strengths
- Integration happens through human guidance

## üéØ Example Collaboration Session

**You ask ChatGPT:**
"I need to implement real-time polyphonic transcription for my music visualization system. Here's my current FFT analysis code: [paste code]. How can I separate multiple instruments in real-time?"

**ChatGPT responds with algorithm suggestions**

**You bring to Claude:**
"ChatGPT suggested using STFT with overlapping windows and spectral subtraction for instrument separation. Can we implement this approach in our audio processor?"

**Claude implements and tests the solution in the actual codebase**

This creates a powerful feedback loop combining theoretical knowledge with practical implementation.
