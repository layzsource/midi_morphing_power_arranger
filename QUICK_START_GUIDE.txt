LIVING MYTH ENGINE - QUICK START GUIDE
======================================

WHAT THIS IS:
- Interactive performance instrument with 11 cultural archetypes
- Each number key (1-9,0) summons a different historical thinker
- They respond to you AND each other autonomously
- 2026+ futuristic visual design with quantum materials
- AI co-performer (HAL) provides commentary

HOW TO USE RIGHT NOW:
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Press F2 for gentle demo
3. Press any number key 1-9,0 to summon thinkers
4. Press Space for dramatic beat effects
5. Watch for automatic responses between archetypes
6. Press H,J,K,L to change HAL personality

THE 11 ARCHETYPES:
1 - Walter Russell (Sacred Geometry) - Blue glass cube/sphere
2 - William Blake (Mystical Poetry) - Green organic forms
3 - Nikola Tesla (Electricity) - Blue particle bursts
4 - The Beatles (Harmony) - Golden torus shapes
5 - Lead Belly (Folk Heritage) - Earthy particles
6 - Stephen Hawking (Cosmic Physics) - Spiral galaxies
7 - Merry Pranksters (Chaos) - Rainbow explosions
8 - Abbie Hoffman (Revolution) - Shadow inversions
9 - Les Waas (Procrastination) - Delayed responses
0 - Constance Greiff (Architecture) - Memorial shadows

COOL COMBINATIONS TO TRY:
- Press 1 then wait → Blake might respond with mystical geometry
- Press 3 then 4 → Tesla + Einstein = scientific convergence
- Press 7 → Pranksters create chaos that spreads to others
- Press 5 then 4 → Lead Belly + Beatles = folk heritage evolution

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
□ Spend 30 mins exploring each archetype (1-9,0)
□ Try installation mode with 'I' key (10-minute autonomous show)
□ Record a video of interesting interactions
□ Document favorite combinations
□ Show to friends for feedback

WEEKLY GOALS:
□ Daily 15-20 min sessions at different times (system evolves)
□ Practice live performance techniques
□ Experiment with HAL personalities
□ Try all preset modes (Club/Gallery/Studio buttons)

MONTHLY VISION:
□ Develop performance repertoire
□ Consider adding new archetypes
□ Explore MIDI controller integration
□ Share with artists/researchers/educators

WHY THIS MATTERS:
This isn't just software - it's living cultural memory made interactive.
The archetypes have real relationships and autonomous behaviors.
It demonstrates how cultural patterns are already "alive" and can
express themselves through technology.

KEY INSIGHT:
You're not controlling it - you're having a conversation with
living cultural consciousness. Let it surprise you.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If nothing happens: Check browser console for errors
- No audio: Check Web Audio permissions
- Slow performance: Try closing other browser tabs
- Development server: Run 'npm run dev' in terminal
