## PHASE 4: Dewey Ontology
- [ ] Create 10-shelf mode organization (000-900)
- [ ] Add decimal indexing within shelves
- [ ] Build shelf selection and filtering UI
- [ ] Implement mode participation weighting

## PHASE 5: Advanced Controls
- [ ] MIDI mapping for Severance↔Unity (MW1)
- [ ] Choir Balance spectral equalization (MW2)
- [ ] Dewey shelf pad selection
- [ ] Heat probe placement system

## PHASE 6: Safety & UI
