# Thick Wire Circles + Cube Implementation - BACKUP

This is a backup of the current thick wire circles with cube wireframe system before creating the circles-only version.

## Current Implementation

### Key Features
- **6 thick circular wire tubes** - actual circles made from thick cylindrical tubes (0.08 radius)
- **Thick cube wireframe** - 12 cube edges as thick tubes
- **Perfect circles** - using EllipseCurve to create true circular paths
- **Unified thickness** - both circles and cube edges use same thick wire appearance

### Current Parameters
```typescript
const tubeRadius = 0.08; // Much thicker wire-like appearance
const tubularSegments = 16;
const radialSegments = 8;
```

### Circle Creation Method
Uses EllipseCurve → CatmullRomCurve3 → TubeGeometry for perfect thick circular wires

### Cube Wireframe Method
Uses LineCurve3 → TubeGeometry for thick cube edge tubes

## Files Modified
- `VesselLayer.ts`: Complete thick wireframe system implementation
- All elements positioned and oriented correctly on cube faces

## Status
This system provides:
- Actual thick circular wires (not donuts/rings)
- Substantial wire presence (0.08 radius)
- Perfect geometric relationships
- Modern 2025+ materials with metallic finish

## Next Step
Create version with just the 6 connected circles, removing cube wireframe while maintaining circle connections.
